- File: The file command determines the file type of a file. It reports the file type in human readable format (e.g. ‘ASCII text’) or MIME type (e.g. ‘text/plain; charset=us-ascii’). As filenames in UNIX can be entirely independent of file type file can be a useful command to determine how to view or work with a file.


- Strings: finds and prints text strings embedded in all files strings filename

- binwalk: Binwalk is a fast, easy to use tool for analyzing, reverse engineering, and extracting firmware images. Binwalk is a great tool for extracting hidden files from other files as well.

- Hexeditor: A hex editor, also called a binary file editor or byteeditor, is a type of program that allows a user to view and edit the raw and exact contents of files, that is, at the byte level

- xxd: is a Linux command that creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form. Like uuencode(1) and uudecode(1) it allows the transmission of binary data in a “mail-safe” ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.

- stegsolv: A great GUI tool that covers a wide range of analysis, some of which is covered by the other tools mentioned above and a lot more including color profiles, planes, Color maps, strings.
