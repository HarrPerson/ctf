# Pentesting Fundamentals

## What is Penetration Testing? 

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## Penetration Testing Ethics 

Recall that a penetration test is an **authorised audit** of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. The legality of penetration is pretty clear-cut in this sense; anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised.

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion **forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement** and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

Companies that provide penetration testing services are held against legal frameworks and industry accreditation. For example, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has the CHECK accreditation scheme in the UK. This check means that only "[CHECK]  approved companies can conduct authorised penetration tests of public sector and CNI systems and networks." (NCSC).

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?).

#### Permission

This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.

#### Test Scope

This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.

#### Rules

The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

## Penetration Testing Methodologies 

#### Information Gathering	

This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.

Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.


#### Enumeration/Scanning

This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

#### Exploitation

This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

#### Privilege Escalation

Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

#### Post-exploitation	

This stage involves a few sub-stages:

1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user

3.  Covering your tracks

4. Reporting
